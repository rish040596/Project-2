# Project-2

Singapore's high GDP/capita fuels a high level of consumption and a significant problem with household waste from discarded items including furniture, toys, books, appliances and cookware. There is a particular problem with consumer electronics - a 2014 UN study revealed that each Singapore resident generated approximately 20kg of e-waste per year. Many of the discarded items have re-use potential but there is an absence of infrastructure for connecting discarded items to new users as well as some cultural barriers to acceptance of second-hand items.

The application tackles this issue.
